\section{Quests} \label{section.quests}
	Here's a short walkthrough of each of the quests.

	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{screenshots/quests}
		\caption{The in-game quest screen.}
	\end{figure}
	
	Now, to make it easier to find each of the items there is a little trick that can be done. When looking at the source of the HTML page with the game, you can find the following
	
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=1]{"screenshots/canvas html"}
	\end{figure}
	
	The canvas with id 'floating' is what renders the overlay of certain objects, such as the roofs and such. Now, since the site is using jQuery, it's quite easy to toggle the visibility of items, when they have an id. So open the developer console..
	
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=1]{"screenshots/coins"}
	\end{figure}
	
	Type in \lstinline!jQuery("#floating").toggle()! and it'll toggle the visibility. The reason to use toggle, is to make it easy to hit arrow up and hit enter, to toggle it again.

	\subsection{Find Santa} \label{subsection.quest_find_santa}
		So, to find Santa one needs to solve a few of the terminals, more specifically \autoref{terminal4} and \autoref{terminal5}. \textit{Now, to be honest, I'm not sure if you have to solve the rest of the terminals, but if you do, check out the solutions in \autoref{section.part3}}.\\
		\\
		Once those 2 terminals are solved you can go to 1978. Once there, head back up into the workshop and in through the door that belongs to \autoref{terminal4} and you will find Santa waiting for you.
	
	\subsection{Complete the Cranberry Pi} \label{subsection.quest_cranberry_pi}
		You get this quest when you speak with Holly Evergreen in The North Pole. She asks you to find all the pieces of a Cranberry Pi. Go to the locations shown in the following 5 figures, once you collected all the items, return to Holly Evergreen and she will give you the Cranberry Pi image, which is needed to complete Part 3\footnote{See \autoref{section.part3} to see how to complete this part.} of the story line.

	\subsection{Find the NetWars Challenge Coins} \label{subsection.quest_find_netcoins}
		So there are 20 coins to find in total. 13 in today's world and 7 in the year 1978. Some coins are only reachable once you complete terminals, so this means that to collect them all you need to solve most of the terminals. How to solve them can be found in \autoref{section.part5}. Once the terminals are completed, or while moving between them check out these locations.
		
		\subsubsection*{Today}
			All these coins are found in today's world.

	\subsection{Find the villain} \label{subsection.quest_find_the_villian}
		Once you have recovered atleast five\footnote{That's what the folks over at SANS say, anyway} of the seven audio files you can follow the steps in \autoref{section.part5} to get the password for the door in the hallway behind the bookcase in Santa's office.\textit{Phew, long sentence.}\\
		\\
		Enter the password and then go inside and meet the Doctor himself.
